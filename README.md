# DivinaPopinaV2

## Project Overview

DivinaPopinaV2 is a full-stack mock e-commerce platform designed to demonstrate professional-grade architecture, code quality, and deployment hygiene. This project is intended for client demonstration and technical review, not for production use.

**Key Features:**
- Modern React frontend with API-only data access
- Python backend (Quart, SQLAlchemy) with clear domain boundaries
- Explicit mock boundaries for all financial, payment, and shipment operations
- Professional .gitignore and repo hygiene
- Demonstrates error handling, loading/empty states, and maintainable structure

---

## Mock Project Notice

> **All financial, shipment, and payment operations in this project are mocked.**
>
> - No real money, payment, or shipment transactions occur.
> - Domain logic is real; all external side effects are simulated.
> - This is intentional for demonstration and client review purposes.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required environment variables.

## Environments
- ENV=dev|test|prod (set in .env)

## Run
- Backend: `python -m backend.app`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install && npm start`

### Docker (backend + frontend)

Run both services with live reload and API proxying.

Prerequisites:
- Docker Desktop 4.x

Steps:
1. Optionally copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and adjust values.
2. Build and start services:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Services:
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- The frontend dev server proxies requests starting with `/api` to the backend inside Docker, so calls like `/api/finance/...` or `/api/product/...` work without CORS hassle.
- The SQLite database `dev.db` is created in the backend working directory inside the container and is visible in your workspace due to the volume mount.

## Test
- Backend: `pytest`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm test`

## Deploy
- See ARCHITECTURE.md and SECURITY.md for deployment and security notes.
